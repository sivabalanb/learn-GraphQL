# Learn GraphQL - Unleash the Power of Data Querying 🚀

GraphQL is like magic for your API! ✨ It's not just a query language, but a supercharged runtime that puts you in control. Say goodbye to fixed data endpoints; with GraphQL, you choose what you get. 🎩🔮

## What is GraphQL?


GraphQL is a query language for your API, and it also serves as a runtime for executing those queries by defining a server-side API contract.

🚀 Unlike REST, where you get a fixed set of data in each endpoint, in GraphQL, you request exactly the data you need and get only that data in response.

## GraphQL Types 📊

GraphQL supports a range of built-in scalar types:
- 📝 `String`: For text data.
- 🔢 `Int`: For integer numbers.
- 📈 `Float`: For floating-point numbers.
- 🧪 `Boolean`: For true or false values.
- 🆔 `ID`: For unique identifiers.

## Getting Started 🏁

To dive into the world of GraphQL and start exploring its wonders, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install your favorite GraphQL server (e.g., Apollo Server, Express with express-graphql, or any other).
3. Run your server.
4. Begin writing GraphQL queries and unleash your superpowers!

## Stay Curious 🧐

GraphQL is a fantastic tool for making your API dreams come true. With endless possibilities, it's time to explore and create data-driven magic! 🔮
